## Version History

Week 9 Changelog:

* Older Version:
	* Added an alternative AoE effect. The AoE shoots 4 blasts in a crossroad pattern every few seconds. 
[CONSIDER]: Have this be a 8 directional AoE? Maybe as a powerup?
* Version 0.3:
	* Merged 0.22 and 0.21 branches. This has all of the new aesthetic changes implemented.
In summary, Thanos model is now implemented.
* Version 0.31:
	* Implemented the fifth stone ability. I combined my ideas for a time-based stone with a soul-based stone.
